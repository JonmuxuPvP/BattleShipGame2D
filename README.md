# BattleShipGame2D
Welcome to my Java BattleShipGame2D. I clearly do not have an original name for it, but I doubt I will ever come up with something interesting. The game features adventure mode and free play mode as well as options to customize certain settings. The objective is to plan your strategy on shopping items and letting an automatic AI play for you against other CPUs.

## Multiplayer
The game is Local-Multiplayer 2P only. If possible, I would like to add an online mode.

## Running the Game
You can find the game on the releases tab if you would like to download it.
In order to play the game though, you need to open up cmd or any console on your OS and execute the jar file from there with the following command:
```
java -jar [path].jar
```
It's the only way the game can be executed for now since there is no Graphical User Interface yet.
