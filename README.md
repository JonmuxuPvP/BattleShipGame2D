# BattleShipGame2D
Welcome to my Java BattleShip2D Game. I clearly do not have an original name for it, but I doubt I will ever come up with something interesting. The game features adventure mode and free play mode as well as options to customize certain settings. The objective is to plan your strategy on shopping items and letting an automatic AI play for you against other CPUs.

## Running the Game
In order to play the game, you need to open up cmd or any console on your OS and execute the jar file from there with the following command:
```
java -jar [path].jar
```
It's the only way you can execute the game for now since there is no Graphical User Interface yet.
